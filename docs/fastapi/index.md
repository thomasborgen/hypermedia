# Hypermedia and FastAPI

Hypermedia can be used with any framework, but was created with FastAPI in mind and thus ships with some utility functions.

In FastAPI you create function and decorate them to create routes. When FastAPI gets a request it looks for a function that is decorated with a path that matches the url. 

This section assumes you have read the [html](/html) section of the documentation.


## Returning html in FastAPI



```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from hypermedia import Div

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("", response_class=HTMLResponse)
async def index(request: Request) -> None:
    """Return an index page."""
    return Div("Hello world").dump()

```

This is all you have to do. open `localhost:port` in your browser and you should get a page with the text `Hello world`.

Notice the `.dump()`

with @htmx decorator

```python
@app.get("", response_class=HTMLResponse)
@htmx
async def index(
    request: Request,
    partial: Element = Depends(render_simple_flows_index_partial),
    full: Element = Depends(full(render_simple_flows_index)),
) -> None:
    """Return the list of transformers."""
    pass


```



```python
from hypermedia.fastapi import htmx, full
```

The `partial` argument is a function that returns the partial HTML.
The `full` argument is a function that needs to return the whole HTML, for example on first navigation or a refresh.

> Note: `partial` and `full` arguments needs to be wrapped in `Depends` so that the full function's dependencies are resolved! Hypermedia ships an extra `full` wrapper, which is basically just making the function lazily loaded. The `full` wrapper _must_ be used, and the `@htmx` decorator will call the lazily wrapped function to get the full HTML page when needed.

> Note: The following code is in FastAPI, but could have been anything. As long as you check for HX-Request and return partial/full depending on if it exists or not.

```python
def render_base():
    """Return base HTML, used by all full renderers."""
    return ElementList(Doctype(), Body(slot="body"))


def render_fruits_partial():
    """Return partial HTML."""
    return Div(Ul(Li("Apple"), Li("Banana"), Button("reload", hx_get="/fruits")))


def render_fruits():
    """Return base HTML extended with `render_fruits_partial`."""
    return render_base().extend("body", render_fruits_partial())


@router.get("/fruits", response_class=HTMLResponse)
@htmx
async def fruits(
    request: Request,
    partial: Element = Depends(render_fruits_partial),
    full: Element = Depends(full(render_fruits)),
) -> None:
    """Return the fruits page, partial or full."""
    pass
```

That's it. Now we have separated the rendering from the endpoint definition and handled returning partials and full pages when needed. Doing a full refresh will render the whole page. Clicking the button will make a htmx request and only return the partial.

What is so cool about this is that it works so well with FastAPI's dependency injection.

## Really making use of dependency injection


```python
fruits = {1: "apple", 2: "orange"}

def get_fruit(fruit_id: int = Path(...)) -> str:
    """Get fruit ID from path and return the fruit."""
    return fruits[fruit_id]

def render_fruit_partial(
    fruit: str = Depends(get_fruit),
) -> Element:
    """Return partial HTML."""
    return Div(fruit)

def render_fruit(
    partial: Element = Depends(render_fruit_partial),
):
    return render_base().extend("content", partial)

@router.get("/fruits/{fruit_id}", response_class=HTMLResponse)
@htmx
async def fruit(
    request: Request,
    partial: Element = Depends(render_fruit_partial),
    full: Element = Depends(full(render_fruit)),
) -> None:
    """Return the fruit page, partial or full."""
    pass
```

Here we do basically the same as the previous example, except that we make use of FastAPI's great dependency injection system. Notice the path of our endpoint has `fruit_id`. This is not used in the definition. However, if we look at our partial renderer, it depends on `get_fruit`, which is a function that uses FastAPI's `Path resolver`. The DI then resolves (basically calls) the fruit function, passes the result into our partial function, and we can use it as a value!

__This pattern with DI, Partials, and full renderers is what makes using FastAPI with HTMX worth it.__

In addition to this, one thing many are concerned about with HTMX is that since we serve HTML, there will be no way for another app/consumer to get a fruit in JSON. But the solution is simple:

Because we already have a dependency that retrieves the fruit, we just need to add a new endpoint:

```python
@router.get("/api/fruit/{fruit_id}")
async def fruit(
    request: Request,
    fruit: str = Depends(get_fruit),
) -> str:
    """Return the fruit data."""
    return fruit
```

Notice we added `/api/` and just used DI to resolve the fruit and just returned it. Nice!
