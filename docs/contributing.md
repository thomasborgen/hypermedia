# Contributing

The best thing that can be contributed with is bug reports and documentation.

To help with documentation fork the repo, and run the mkdocs site with:

```sh
uv sync

uv run mkdocs serve
```

!!! tip

    Add `--livereload` to enable autorefresh

This starts up a server at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) navigate there and start adding or editing the doc files in `/docs`
