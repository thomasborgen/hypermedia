# Contributing

The best thing that can be contributed with is bug reports and documentation.

To help with documentation fork the repo, and run the mkdocs site with:

```sh
pyenv install

poetry install

poetry run mkdocs serve 
```

This starts up a server at `localhost:8000` navigate there and start adding or editing the doc files in `/docs`
